# What is this?

This will be the basis for a web page that allows the user to set the current variables the day / game state (achievements) to quickly see where the villager of interest is. Plan to use PHP and JS for front and backend.

Current plans
~ view that displays dynamic walk cycle of all villagers, or only some if selected
~ view that lets you search the villager name, and gives print location and zoomed in map 
~ output will be based on current user completion / weather
